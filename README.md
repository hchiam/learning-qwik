# Learning the [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io) JS framework

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

Lazy-load JS via HTML attributes upon interaction, instead of hydrating on page load. It looks a lot like React. A key concept is "resumability". Allegedly `O(1)` instead of `O(n)`.

Consider using [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/), which is Qwik+Routing, like NextJS is to React.

```sh
npm create qwik@latest
```

(Using [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn) with `yarn create qwik@latest` doesn't seem to work for me.)

## further research:

what about security?
